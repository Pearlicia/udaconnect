There are five different microservices (1) Connection-service, which uses REST.
(2) Person-service which saves the persons data to both kafka and postgres
(3) location-service which saves the location data to both kafka and postgres
(4) grpc-location Uses grpc to save location data to postgres
(5) kafka-service saves to create a topics and get topics through consumer

My rationale behind it is to gain experience implementing different types of message passing 
techniques and tools.
